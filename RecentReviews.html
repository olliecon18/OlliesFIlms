    <div class="My-review">
      <p>Directed by superhero film expert James Gunn comes a refreshing story of a band of supervillains, blended with comic book silliness and ultraviolence.
      The film features interesting and whacky characters played by well-known actors such as Margot Robbie, Idris Elbra and John Cena. 'The Suicide Squad' prides
      itself on embracing its dark comedy moments and wastes no time in throwing audiences right into the madness from the beginning.
      Gunn has proven himself yet again that he understands comic book characters, and can successfully depict them on the big scene.
      If there ends up being a sequel I will be very keen to check it out.</p>

      <p>'A Quiet Place 2' is directed by John Krasinski and is the sequel to the 2018 film. The film takes place in a world where creatures have taken over earth
      and hunt the remaining humans by sound. The film once again delivers through its tension and thrills, with its plot being just as creative and interesting
    as the first film. The performances of all actors is a stand out, delivering a a lot of great moments especially in the third
  act. Overall I enjoyed this film just as much as the first and will definitly recommend to those who have not seen it.</p>

      <p>Where do I begin. I went into 'Space Jam 2' with very low expectations, and yet they still weren't met. The worlds favourite
      Looney Tunes characters are back and this time, alongside NBA superstar Lebron James, who has to fight a group of monsters in a game of basketball
    to return to Earth. Unfortunately, this film is one giant big commercial for Lebron James and Warner Bros, with shocking and unconvincing performances
    from all involved. The film knew it was being silly and goofy, however, there was no charm that the original had, which was very much expected, but still a let down.
    I will most likely never see this film again.</p>

        <p>'Malcom & Marie' stars Zendaya and John David Washington and is a story about romance, tension and emotional reckoning. I somewhat enjoyed the films
        writing and performances from both actors, yet is essentially an hour and forty minutes of uncomfortable arguing between the two, which
      made watching it emotionally exhausting. There is alot to take in with this film, and honestly I was not as invested in the characters maybe
    as much as I should have been. This film deserves a rewatch, but from the trailer, I was expecting a story of romance, not necessarily confliction.</p>

          <div class="My-review">
          <p>Directed by Zack Snyder comes his original Justice League vision film, after having to leave its original 2017 version due to family issues. This film is around
          4 hours long and I loved all of it. Whether it was the performances from all actors, 4:3 aspect ratio or huge action sequences in the third act, the film
        proved it meant to be something greater in 2017. There are plenty of emotional moments which are backed by Junkie XL's loud and meaningful score. Overall, although
      the films duration is too much for the casual movie watcher, if you are a fan of the superhero genre in anyway I recommend checking this out if you have not.</p>
