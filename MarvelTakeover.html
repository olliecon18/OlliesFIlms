      <p>The film to begin the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 'Iron Man' follows billionaire playboy turned hero, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr)
      and his journey of becoming a symbol of hope for both America, and the world. Jon Favreau does a masterful job at introducing audiences to the superhero universe, whilst keeping the film light-heared and action packed.</p>

      <p>Continuing on from the first film, 'Iron Man 2' follows Tony Stark as he reveals to the world of his identity, which in course brings out those who want to see the billionaires downfall.
        Directed again by Jon Favreau, the film explores important themes of growth and a search for self discovery. The film includes more action, CGI that still looks fantastic and a list of memorable cast members;
        including Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scartlett Jodansson and Samuel L. Jackson, all of which we see again in future films.</p>

      <p>Kenneth Branagh's norse MCU entry 'Thor' is a good first introduction to the character that is unfortunately dampened by its predictability and rough dialogue.
        Starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins, the film explores a whole different fantasy world backed by great CGI and cinematography.
        Admittedly, the dialogue failed to engage me as much as previous Marvel films, but the rest of the film succeeds at introducing new characters to viewers in anticipation for 'The Avengers', set to release the following year.</p>

      <p>'Captain America: The First Avenger' follows Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a skinny kid from Brooklyn with a dream to serve his country,
        who's life changes when he becomes an experimental super soldier to fight the Nazis in WW2.
        The film does a great job at introducing Captain America into the superhero universe as we follow along in his origin story,
        his life with his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and lover, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).
        The First Avenger is entertaining with an enjoyable story arc, followed by themes of honour, humanity and love.</p>

      <p>Directed by Joss Whedon, 'The Avengers' sees MCU characters introduced in previous films come together for the first time to face an evil that plans to take over the world.
        The film succeeds in portaying all of our favourite superheros together, filled with action packed fight scenes all throughout.
        A highlight from the film is its engaging soundtrack, composed by Alan Silvestri, in which gave us the Avengers theme which has become extremely popular years later.
        'The Avengers' offers up a straightforward plot, dramatic moments, and great humour, and is definitly one of the better MCU films. </p>

      <p>The first MCU film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, 'The Winter Soldier' is one of my personal favourite Marvel films.
        Captain America is back, and this time is tested, when an assasin called the winter soldier is out for the Captain and his allies.
        The film sees success on so many different levels through its fast-paced action, dialogue, editing and acting.
        The plot is a rollercoaster adventure that doesnt stop on any turn, and strives on keeping the viewers entertained.
        It's obvious this film is loved amongst fans, with Marvel recruiting the Russo brothers to come back and direct various other MCU movies.</p>

      <p>Directed by James Gunn, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' follows a group of misfits who come together to form an unexpected alliance.
        Starring Christ Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, the film stands out as being one of the most unique Marvel films to date, taking risks that previous films didn't go near.
        'Guardians' is hilarious from start to finish with great acting and VFX all throughout. The writing, soundtrack and characters are all highlights, and overall the film is a hilarious rewatch years later. </p>

      <p>While 'Age of Ultron' may not be as good as it's predecessor 'The Avengers' the film is still a great watch which brings back all our favourite characters again to fight against another sinister evil. The enemy, Ultron, is a creation of scientific advancement which turns on the superheroes and reveals its terrible plans to destroy the planet.
        Whedon comes back to direct this film, and introduces us to new likeable characters alongside the ones we love. The film does a brilliant job of exloring each charcter further, whilst also sticking to its film formula of being another action packed adventure with great VFX.</p>

      <p>Directed by The Russo Brothers once again, Captain America is back alongside The Avengers, but this time, there has been a split of ideals between the Captain and Iron Man, leading to a battle between two allies.
        The film is fueled by its fantastic writing, which carries emotional weight and conflict. 'Civil War' includes a range of important characters, with the Russo Brothers ensuring everyone gets their respective screen time and development.
        However, sometimes the CGI tends to be lazy, almost taking me out of the story to make me realise I am watching a film. The Russo Brothers do a masterful job and portraying the best of both worlds of big superhero action filled with drama and intensity.</p>

          <p>Directed by Scott Derrickson, 'Doctor Strange' starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. The film proves that superhero films can still be fresh, original and innovative years later after 'Iron Man'.
            Cumberbatch brings together a new interesting, down-to-earth and relateable character to the Marvel universe. Highlights of the film include its astonishing VFX and magic fight sequences, making the 2nd and 3rd act imaginative and fresh.
            The plot is simple yet engaging, with the soundtrack playing a huge roll in keeping audiences guessing. Personally, 'Doctor Strange' is one of my top 5 Marvel films, and is a great origin story to a very powerful comic book character.</p>

          <p>Directed once again by James Gunn, in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' we follow our favourite band of space misfits on another adventure in search of family and identity.
            Overall 'Vol 2' is another hilarious installment in the Guardians series with the sequel having just as much heart and soul as the first film.
            While it's not without flaws, such as some forced humour at times in the first act, we get a deeper dive into the development of each character that in turn, makes the film quite emotionally engaging.
            The chemistry with the cast is as good as ever and I am very excited to watch 'Vol 3' when it is released.</p>

    <p>'Spiderman: Homecoming' stars Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and Zendaya, as we follow the life of teenage superhero Peter Parker, as he learns to take on his role of being Spiderman, whilst also living the life of a nerdy high school teenager.
      The film has a enjoyable plot and suprising villain we have not seen in a Spiderman film. The soundtrack is ok at best, with no real standout moments.
      Personally the film lacks any real weight or substance, especially in comparison to the original Spiderman films of the 2000's.
       Much of the scenes of Peter in high school were quite bland, and included poor writing which lost me whilst watching.
       Overall, 'Homecoming' is an standard Spiderman film, and mediocre Peter Parker film, which is led down by its poor writing and boring scenes that outweigh the exciting third act.</p>
